# Hotel-Booking-Analysis-EDA

# Problem Statement : 
Have you ever wondered when the best time of year to book a hotel room is? Or the optimal length of stay in order to get the best daily rate? What if you wanted to predict whether or not a hotel was likely to receive a disproportionately high number of special requests? This hotel booking dataset can help you explore those questions! This data set contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel and includes information such as when the booking was made, length of stay, the number of adults, children, and/or babies, and the number of available parking spaces, among other things. All personally identifying information has been removed from the data.
Explore and analyze the data to discover important factors that govern the bookings.

# Project Summary:
The Hotel business is a profitable yet very volatile business segment. It depends on many criteria like hotel location, business seasons, customer segment, multiple modes of booking, etc. Since the COVID-19 pandemic has imposed many limits on travel and tourism, the hotel sector, a key driver of the global economyâ€™s growth, has suffered greatly.

Now many business leaders and entrepreneurs are adopting data analytics as technology advances. Data Analytics for hotel management can help in studying demand and customer behavior to boost overall profits.

By applying Exploratory Data Analysis principles and feature engineering, this study aims to explore the merits of analysis on the hotel dataset that governs bookings and can help in increasing the customer base. The secondary objective is to help the customers decide the best period to visit places while availing of low accommodation cost benefits.

In this project, we were provided a dataset containing booking information about two types of hotels and various other related booking criteria. This dataset contains a total rows 119390 and 32 columns. This dataset contains many features like hotel: Name of hotel ( City or Resort), is_canceled: Whether the booking is canceled or not, arrival_date: date, months, year, week of arrival, stays_in_weekend_nights, stays_in_week_nights, number of members adults, children, babies, Meal, country of customer belongs, market_segment: What segment via booking was made and for what purpose, distribution_channel: Via which medium booking was made, is_repeated_guest: Whether the customer has made any booking before, and many booking related features.

The first step of the approach involved Data Exploration and Inspection of the raw data. The second step involved Data Cleaning by handling null values, dropping irrelevant columns and rows, and removing duplicate values that can help in better decision support. The final step involved performing a comprehensive data analysis over clean data to analyze the factors that affect hotel bookings and creating Data Visualization for the same.
